Metaverse Anti Cheat 

### Summary

This is a rubust, flexibale and scalable solution that prevents scenarios where a user is able to cheat in a digital world.
The solution is a contribution to the Tezos developer comminuty - it's open source (MIT license)

### Live Demo

### Concept
Metaverse Anti-Cheat addresses the most common vulnerabilities in blockchain gaming. It secures the vulnarbility of JS injection, where an attacker will  get between the game and web layer to spoof win scenarios.


### UI and UX

Metaverse-Anti-Cheat is designed to work with [Flexcrow](https://github.com/Blockchain-Alchemy/Flexscrow), it uses best practices in UX, by implementing the [MUI  framework](https://mui.com/) in react and optimized Unity framework. 

### Components
- Game Layer (Unity, react, next)
- Server Layer (node)
- Smart Contract Layer (Michelson)

### System Diagram


### Limitations, Potential Risks and Security Questions

Metaverse Anti-Cheat is created to secure against the most common attack: JS injection, however attackers will find new attacks and this package will be mmaintained and used actively in the games we publish and deploy.

### Prequisites
The following dependencies are required to run Flexscrow:

| Dependency | Version             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Node       | `v12.18.4` or above |

### Recommended Use

Metaverse Anti-Cheat is designed to be used with [Flexcrow](https://github.com/Blockchain-Alchemy/Flexscrow) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)](LICENSE)

### Maintain Support and Future Plans
Metaverse Anti-Cheat  is created to be the Anti-Cheat system we'll be using and updating for all our projects. Some projects that will implement Flexcrow are:
- PiXLtez
- Tez Run
